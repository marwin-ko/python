class C1:
   def __init__(self, a, b):
       self.c = a + b

class C2:
   obj1 = None
   def __init__(self):
      self.d = 1

   @classmethod
   def class1(cls, x, y):
       cls.obj1 = C1(x, y)

C2.class1(2, 3)

obj2 = C2()
print(obj2.obj1.c)  # Output would be 5
obj22 = C2()
print(obj22.obj1.c) # Output would be same as above i.e 5
